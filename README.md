## PA5 Title: Dermatological Image Classification for Melanoma Detection

## Description:
In this project, I tackled the classification of dermatological images to distinguish between melanoma (a dangerous skin cancer) and nevus (a harmless birthmark). Using a subset of the 2018 ISIC challenge dataset, I developed machine learning models to automate the detection process. This assignment involved implementing ML architectures for image classification, exploring various solutions, and comparing their effectiveness. I documented the code and findings in a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook and a detailed technical report. The project aimed to enhance our skills in machine learning for images and improve technical writing abilities.
